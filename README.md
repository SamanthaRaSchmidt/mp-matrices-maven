The Questions and Answers section of the project page was used to help me with my initial implementation and ideas for where to start. Found at: https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC207/2024Fa/mps/mp06.html.

While I did not directly consult, due to the MP on "abstract games" I had access to Jenifer Silva's implementations of matrices and understood more of how they worked based on how we used them in our game. While I tried to avoid looking at her code to not accidentally copy pieces or overuse code that was not mine, I did end up having to look at it a few times for debugging our game and therefore had help with implementing by seeing ideas in the code.
